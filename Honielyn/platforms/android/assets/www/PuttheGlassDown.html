<font size="14"><p>A professor began his class by holding up a glass with some water in it. He held it up for all to see and asked the students,"How much do you think this glass weighs</p>
<p>
50 gms!... 100 gms! ...125gms..the students answered.
"I really dont know unless I weigh it, said the professor," but ,my question is.. what would happen if I held it up like this for a new minutes?</p>
<p>
"Nothing"the students said.
Ok!What would happen if I held it up like this for an hour?the professor asked.</p>
<p>
Your arm would begin to ache,"said one of the students.
You're right. Now what would happen If I held it for a day?</p>
<p>
Your arm could go munb. you mught have severe muscle stress and paralysis and have to go to hospital for sure ! ventured another student and all the students laughed.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

<p>

</p>
<p>

<p>

<p>
Its important to think of the challenges in yoyr life. But even more important is to have trust in him and put them down at the end of everyday before you go to sleep. Thay way youre stressed, you wake up everyday fresh and strong and can handle any issue and any challenges that come to you</p>
