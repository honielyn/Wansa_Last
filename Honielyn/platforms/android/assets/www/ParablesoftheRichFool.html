<font size="14"><p>"Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the enhiritance with me." </p>
<p>
"Jesus replied," Man,who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?"Then he said to them," watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions".</p>
<p>
"And he told them this parable: " The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest.He thought to himself,"What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops."</p>
<p>
"Then he said," This is what i'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. and i'll say to myself," You have plenty of grain laid up for many years.Take life easy; eat,drink and be merry."</p>
<p>
"But God said to him," You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?"</p>
<p>
"This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God".</p>
