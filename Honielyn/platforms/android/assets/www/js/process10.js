<center><h1>The Parable of Love</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>As Israel was disintergrating, a word from God came to Hosea.Suffering people needed to hear a softer tone, and Hosea brought a hoped-filled message of grace and forgiveness.</p>
<p>
Most prophets focused on the audience all the things they had done wrong. In contrast, Hosea shind the spotligth on God.How must God feel when his chosen pople reject him and go panting after false Gods?</p>
<p>
As if words are too weak to convey his passion, God asked the rave Hosea to act out a living parable.Hosea married a loose womannamed Gomer,who,true to form,quickly ran away and committed adultery. Only by living out this drama could Hosea understand, and than express,something of how God felt concerning Israel's rebuff of his affections.</p>
<p>
Poor Hosea lived a soap opera-like existence. Gomer sank so slow as to sell herself into slavery, But Hosea purchased her back, forgave her and reclaimed her as his wife. The pattern hopelessly repeated itself.Gomer bore three children-but was Hosea really their father? According to the law, he should have turned his adulterous wife out on the street or had her tried in court. What Hosea did- and what God did was unprecendented.</p>
