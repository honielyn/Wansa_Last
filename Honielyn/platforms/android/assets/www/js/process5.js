<center><h1>Friends in The Desert</h1>
<font size="14"><p>Two friends walking through the Desert. During some point of the journey, They had an argument and one friend slapped the other one in the face. The one who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything,wrote in the sand:</p>
<p>
"Today my bestfriend splapped me in the face."</p>
<p>
They kept on walking, until they found an oasis, Where they decided to take a bath. The one who have been slapped got stuck in the mire and stared drowning, But the friend save him. After he recovered from the near drowning,he wrote on the stone:</p>
<p>
"Today my bestfriend saved my life."</p>
<p>
The friend who had slapped and saved his bestfriend asked him,"After I hurt yoy,you wrote in the sand and now ,you write on the stone,why?"</p>
<p>
The friend replied,when someone hurts us we should write it down on the sand,where the winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But when someone does something good for us. we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it.</p>
