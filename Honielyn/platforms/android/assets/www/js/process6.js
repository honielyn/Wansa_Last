<center><h1>Lazarus and the Richman</h1></center>
    <font size="14"><p>"There was a richman who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury everyday. At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores  and longing to eat what fell from the richman's table. Even the dogs cae and licked his sores." </p>
<p>
"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The richman also died and was buried. In hades , whre he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him," Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire". </p>
<p>
"But Abraham replied," son, remember that in your lifetime you recieved your good things, while Lazarus recieved bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. And besides all this , between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot , nor can anyone cross over from there to us."</p>
<p>
"He answered," Then I beg you, father,send lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to his place of torment."</p>
<p>
"Abraham replied," They have Moses and the prophets; Let them listen to them".</p>
<p>
"No father Abraham," he said,"but  if someonefrom the dead goes to them,they will repent."</p>
<p>
" He said to him," If they do not listen to moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead."</p>
