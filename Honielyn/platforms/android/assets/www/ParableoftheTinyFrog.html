<font size="14"><p>Once upon a time there was a bunch of tiny frogs..Who arraged a climbing competition. The goal was to teach the top of a very high tower.</p>
<p>
A big crowd had gathered around the tower to see the race and cheer on the contestant. The race began..</p>
<p>
honestly: No one in the crowd really believed that the tiny frogs would reach the top of the tower. you heard statements such as:"Oh, way too difficult!".They wil never make it to the top." Not a cance that they will succeed." the tower is too high!".</p>
<p>
The tiny frigs began collapsing . One by one ..Except for those, who kept a fresh tempo and kept climbing higher and higher.</p>
<p>
The crowd continue to yell,"It is too difficult!" No one will make it !.More tiny frogs got tired and gave up..</p>
<p>
But one continued higher and higher and higher..This one wouldn't give up!</p>
<p>
At the end everyone else had given up climbing the tower. Except for the one iny frog who, after a big effort, was the only one who reached the top!</p>
<p>
All the other tiny frogs naturally wanted to know how this one managed to do it. A contestant asked the tiny frog how he had found the strength to succeed and reach the goal!</p>
<p>
It turned out..the winner is a deaf. The wisdom of this story is: Never listen to other's people tendencies to be negative or pessimistic.. They take your most wonderful dreams and wishes away from you if you let them-the ones you have in you heart!</p>
