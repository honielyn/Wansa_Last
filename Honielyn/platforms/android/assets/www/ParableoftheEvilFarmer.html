<center><h1>Parable of the Evil Farmer</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>A certain landowner planted a vineyard, Built a wall around it,dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice, and built a lookout tower.Then he leased the vineyard to tenant farmers and moved to another country</p>
<p>
At the time of the grape harvest, he sent his servants to collect his share  of the crop. But the farmers grabbed his servants,beat one,killed one,and stoned another. So the landowner sent a larger group of his servants to collect for him,but the results were the same.</p>
<p>
Finally, the owner sent his son,thinking,"Surely they will respect my son."</p>
<p>
But when the tenant farmers saw his son coming,they said to one another,Here Comes the heir to this estate. Come on, Let's kill hm and get the estate for ourselves!, So they grabbed him,dragged him out of the vineyard.and murdered him.</p>
<p>
When the owner of the vineyard returns,"Jesus asked",What do you think he will do to those farmers?"</p>
<p>
The religious leaders replied," He will put the wicked men to a horrible death and lease the vineyard to others who will give him his share of the crop after each harvest."</p>
<p>
Then Jesus asked them," Didn't you ever read this in the scriptures?"</p>
<p>
The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone. This is the Lord's doing and it is wonderful to see."</p>
<p>
I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that will produce the priper fruit. anyone who stambles over that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone it falls on."</p>
<p>
When the leading priest and pharisees heard this parable, they realized he was telling the story against them-they were the wicked farmers. they wanted to arest him,but they wera afraid of the crowds, who considered Jesus to be a prophet.</p>
