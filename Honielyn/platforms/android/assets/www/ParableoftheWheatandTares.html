<font size="14"><p>The kingdom of heaven may compared to a man who showed good seed in his field , But while his men were sleeping,his enemy came and showed weeds anong the wheat and went away.</p>
<p>
So when the plants came came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also and the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, master,did you not sow good seed in your field?"How then does it have weeds? He said to them, An enemy has done this.</p>"
<p>
So the servant said to him. Then do you want us to go and gather them? But he said , No,lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. let both grow together until the harvest , and harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bumdles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
