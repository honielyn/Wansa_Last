<font size="14"><p>Then Jesus said to them,"Suppose someone has a friend. He goes to him at midnight. He says."Friend, lend me three loaves of bread. A friend of mine on a journey has to come to stay with me. I have nothing for him to eat."</p>
<p>
"Then the one inside answers,"Don't bother me. The door is already locked. My children are with me in my bed. I can't get up and give you anything."</p>
<p>
" I tell you, that person will not get up. And he won't give the man bread just because he is his friend. But the man keeps on asking,he will get up. he will ve him as much as he needs"</p>
<p>
"So here is what I say to you. Ask, and it will be given to you.Search,and you will find.Knock, and the door will be opened to you.Everyone who asks will recieve. He who searches will find. And the door will be opened to the one who knocks"</p>
