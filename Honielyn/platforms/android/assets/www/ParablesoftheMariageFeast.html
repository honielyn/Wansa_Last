<font size="14"><p>Jesus spoke to them again in parables,saying : " The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come,but they refused to come.</p>
<p>
"Then he sent some more servants snd said,"Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have ben butchered, and everything is ready.Come on the wedding banquet.".But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his farm,another to his business. And the rest seized his servants ,treated them spitefully,and killed them. But when the king heard about it,he was furious.And he sent out armies,destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.Then he said to his servans."The wedding is ready, But thse who were invited were not worthy. Therefore go to into the highways, and as many as you find,Invite to the wedding." So those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all whom they found,both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guest.</p>
