<center><h1>The Parable of the King and Servant</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,"Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"</p>
<p>
Jesus answered," I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times"</p>
<p>
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to sttle accounts with his servants. As he began the settlement, man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay , the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and that he had be sold to repay the debt.</p>
<p>
The servant fell on his knees before him."Be patient with me." he begged, " And I will pay back everything."The servants master took pity on him,canceled the debt and let him go.</p>
<p>
But when the servant went out, He found one og his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him. Pay back what I owe me!. he demanded." His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him,"Be patient with me, and I will pay you back."</p>
<p>
But he refused. Instead. he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what happened,they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened."Then the master called he servant in. You wicked sservant," he said, I cancelled all the debt of yours you negged me too.</p>
<p>
Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just I as I had on you?" anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured,until he should pay back all he owed." This is how my heavenly father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.</p>
