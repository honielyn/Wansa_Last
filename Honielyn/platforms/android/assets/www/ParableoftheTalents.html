<center><h1>Parable of the Talents</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>"For the Kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country,who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them.And to one he gave five talents,to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own abiloty; and immediately he went on a journey. Then he who had recieved the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents. And likewise he who had received two gained two more also. But who had recieved one went and dug in the ground, and hid his Lord's money. After a long time the lord of those servants came and settled accounts with them.</p>
<p>
"So he who had recieved five talents came and brought five other talents,saying,"Lord,you delivered to me five talents; Look, I have gained five more talents besides them. His lord said to him,"well done,good and faithful servan;you were faithful over a few things,I will make you a ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your Lord.He also had recieved two talents came and said,"Lord,I have gained two more talents besides them ." His Lord said to him,"Welll done ,good and faithful servant; you have been faihtfull over a few things,I will make you ruler  over many things.Enter into the joy of your lord".</p>
<p>
Then who had recieved the one talent came and said,"Lord, I knew you to be a hard man,Reaping where you have not sown,and gathering where you have not scattered seed.And I was afraid, and went  and hid your talent in the ground.Look,there you have what is yours"</p>
<p>
"But his Lord answered and said to him,"Yu wicked and lazy servant,you knew that I reap where I have not sown,and gather where I have not scatteres seed. So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have recieved back my own interest. Therefore take the talent from him,and give it to him who has ten talents.</p>
<p>
For everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have the abundance; but from him who does not have,even what he has will be takenaway. And cast thenunprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</p>
