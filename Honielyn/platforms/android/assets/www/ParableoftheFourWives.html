<center><h1>Parable of the Four Wives</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>Once upon a time , There was a rich merchant who had 4 wives.He loved the 4th wife the most and adorned her with rich robes and treated her to delicacies. He took great care of her and gave her nothing but the best.</p>
<p>
he also loved the 3rd wife very much. he's very proud of her and always wanted to show off her to his friends. However, the merchant is always in fear that she might run away with some other men.</p>
<p>
He too,loved his 2nd wife. She is very cnsiderate person, always patient ad infact is the merchamts confidante. Whenever the merchant  faced some problems, he always turned to his 2nd wife. She would always help him out ad tide him through difficult times. Now, the merchants 1st wife is very loyal partner and has made great contributions in maintaining his wealth and business as well taking care of the hosehold. However, the merchant did not loe the 1st wife and although she love him deepl, he hardly took notice of her</p>
<p>
One day,the merchant fell ill.Before long,he knew that he was ging to die soon. He thought of his luxurious life and tild himself," Now I have 4 wives with me. But when I die, I would be alone . How lonely I would be!"</p>
<p>
Thus, he asked the 4th wife," I loved you ,ost endowed you with the finest clothing and showered great care over you. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?"</p>
<p>
"No way!", replied the 4th wife and she walked away without another word. Answer cut like a sharp knife right into the merchamt's heart.</p>
<p>
The sad merchant then asked the 3rd wife," I have loved you so much for all my life. Now that I'm dying, wil you follow me and keep me company? " 
No! replied the third wife. Life is so good over here! I'm going to remarry when you die! The Merchant's heart sank and turned cold.

<br><br>
He then ask the second wife, I always turned to you for help and you've always help me out. Now I need your help again. When I die, will you follow me and keep me company?

<br> <br>
I'm sorry, I cant help you out this time! Replied the 2nd wife, at the very most I can always send you to your grave. Answer came like a volt of thunder and was devastated. Then a voice, called out. I'll leave with you I will follow where you go.

<br><br>
The merchant look up, and there was the first wife. She was so skinny, almost like she suffered from malnutrition. Waitly grieved, the Merchant's said, I should have taken much better care of you while I could help.  

<br><br>
Actually, we all have four lives in our life. Among the four wives, the fourth wife is our body, no matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look good. I would leave us when we die. Our third wife is our possesion, status and wealth. When we die, they all go to others. The second wife is our family and friends, no matter how close they have been there for us when were alive, the farthest they can stay by us is up to the grave. The first is infact our soul, often neglected in our pursuit of material wealth and sensual pleasure.
