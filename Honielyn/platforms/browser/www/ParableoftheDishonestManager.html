<center><h1>Parable of the Dishonest Manager</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions. And he salled him and said to him. What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.</p>
<p>
And the manager said to himself, What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do , so that when I am removed from management, people may recieve me into their houses.</p>
<p>
So, summoning his master's debtors one by one ,he said to the first , How much do you owe my master? He said, A hundred measures of oil. He said to him, take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty. And how much do you owe ?He said, A hundred  measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill and write eighty.</p>
<p>
The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the son of light . And I tell you , make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may recieve you into the eternal dwellings</p>
<p>
One who is faithful in much, and who is dishonest in much . If then you have not been faithful in that which is anothers who will give you that which is your own?</p>
<p>
No servant can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve god and money</p>
