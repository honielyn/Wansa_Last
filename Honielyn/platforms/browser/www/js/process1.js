<center><h1>Parables of the Great Supper</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>The third part of the discussion around this very eventful meal involved the telling of the parable.Jesus rebuking was making some of the guests nervous, so someone on the table pronounced the blessing on those who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God. Surely it will be a great day when etrnal fellowship with God comes. No doubt the person who speaks  up thinks that all at the table will agree with this blessings. But Jesus takes even this occasion to issue yet another warning through a parable. In effect, he says," Don't count your chickens before they hatch. and don't count your blessings to early. There will be surprises at god's banquet table."</p>
<p>
The parable revolves around a man's to a grand occasion, a great banquet. In the ancient world such a meal  would have been preceded by invitations,which would have been accepted by those planning to attend ,musch like our RSVP. The next step was to hear from the host's servant that the meal was ready , which is exactly what happens in verse 17.</p>
<p>
"So he called everyone of his master's debtors to him, and said to the first," How much do you owe my master? And he said,"A hundred measures of oil." So he said to him,"Take your bill, and sit down quicky and write fifty." Then he said to another , And how much do you owe ?" So he said," A hundred measures of wheat." And he said to him," take your bill,and write eighty." So the master commended the unjust steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in thier generation than the sons of light</p>
<p>
But surprising thing happens on the way to the dinner. last-second refusals puor in,despite the RSVP's.A the text says, they all alike began to make excuses. Jesus notes three particular.</p>
<p>
The first excuse involves the need to check out  a recently bought field.Some ancient purchases did require a postpurchase inspection. So the excuse is a culturally natural one, but it also reveals priorities: something else is more important than this celebration.</p>
<p>
The second excuse involves the purchase of five oxen. Since most ancient landowners had only one or two oxen. This man is clearly wealthy by ancient standards. Ofcourse the reaction again reflects priorities,</p>
<p>
The third excuse involves recent marriage and the desire to spend time with the new bride. The Old testament allowed one to be freed from certain obligation in case of marriage. But it is hard to see why this would be sufficient reason to keep the man from attending this party,especially since he had already accepted the invitation. Again, he is choosing other priorities.</p>
<p>
 The servant tells the masters of the refusals. The master decides, however, that his party will go on anyway.Nothing is to be delayed.</p>
