<font size="14"><p>And he said,"There was a man who had two sons.And the younger of them said to his father,"Father,give me the share of property that is coming to me".And he divided his property between them.not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had  and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living. And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. and he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything. </p>

"But when he came to himself, he said,"How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him,"Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as your hired servants." And he arose and came to his father. But while he is still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to him,"Father,I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son", But the father told to his servants,"Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his foot. and bring the fatenned calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. For this my son was dead. and is alive again; He was lost and is found", And they began to celebrate.</p>

"Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants and askes what these things meant. And he said to him,"Your brother has come, and your father killed the fattened calf, because he has recieved him back safe and sound," But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him, but he answered his father,"Look this many years I have serve you, and never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, That I might celebrtae with my friends," But when this son of yours came,who has devoured  your property with prostitutes, you kiled the fattened calf for him! And he said to him,"Son, you are always with me and all tat is mine is yours. It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found".</p>
