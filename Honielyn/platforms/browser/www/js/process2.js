<center><h1>Butterfly and Cocoon</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>A man found a cocoon of a butterfly. One day a small opening appeared. He sat and watch the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it seemed to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could and could go no father.</p>
<p>
Then the man decided to help the butterfly, So he took a pair of scissors and snipped ogg the remaining bit of the coccon. The butteryfly the emerged easily.But it had swollen body and small.shriveled wings.</p>
<p>
The man continued to watch the butterfly because he expected that,at moment,the wings would enarge and expand to be able to support the body which would contract in time.</p>
<p>
Niether happened!In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crwaling around with swollen body and shriveled wings. It never was able to fly.</p>
<p>
What this man i his kindness and haste did not understand was that the restricting cocoon and the struggle required to the butterfly to get through the tiny opening wera natures way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into wings so that it would be ready for fight once it achieved its freedom from the cocoon.</p>
<p>
Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If nature allowed us to go through your life without any obstacles.it would cripple us.We would not be as strong as what we could have been. And we could never fly..</p>
