<center><h1>Parables of the Barren Fig Tree</h1>
<font size="14">
<p>A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard," Look for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it use up the ground? But he answered and said to him," Sir,let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it. And if it bears fruits,well.But if not , after that you can cut it down.

Fruit trees require a lot of care and proper handling to continue producing luscious fruit year in and year out. It's rewarding to see a tree bending under the weight of apples,pears,oranges or grapefruit. To go into your backyard and pick your own fruit you watched develop and ripen is both instructive and rewarding

Its instructive in that we see how fruit develops on a tree. we see the bloom appear and then the first buds of the fruit begin to grow and develop through the months. Seeing the process teaches more than we learn by going to the market and buying the fruit off the stand. Fruit does'nt just appear in the grocery store; It take time and care to nurture and develop

It's rewarding to take part in the process by which fruits grows.Your efforts combine with the work of nature to bring fruit to harvest.

The harvest of ripened friut is the reason the tree is takng up valuable real estate. Satisfaction is so important in this process that when there is no fruit you stand looking at the tree trying to understand why it has borne no fruit.I've stood looking at barren trees ad asked myself the same question.Before delving further in to the parable , we need to look at the Christ was saying before he gave it to us.
